## Description 

**What was the problem?**
- The HTML, prior to the execution of our project, was not up to par with Accessibility Standards.
  - The index.html was missing semantic elements, and only had &lt;div> tags.
- the CSS file had too many redundancies that could have been simplified to make the code looks cleaner and shorter.

**What would be the foreseeable consequences of the problem?**
- As a result of not being compliant with the Accessibility Standards, the company may face litigation charges.
- As the company evolves, and needs arise to update the codes, the lack of organization and simplification of the codes could increase the chances of _bugs_.

**What were your goals?**
- Make HTML accessible.
- Simplify CSS.
- Fix any pre-existent bug.

**What have we done about it?**
- We made the HTML compliant with the Accessibility Standards.
  - We removed the &lt;div> tags and replaced them with semantic elements, such as &lt;header>, &lt;nav>, &lt;section>, &lt;article>, &lt;aside>, and &lt;footer>.
- We simplified CSS and removed the superfluous repetitions of properties and selectors.
- we fixed the non-functional link element on top of the page "Search Engine Optimization".
